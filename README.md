# LifeExpectancy2020
Objective:
Our objective is to determine the predictors that contribute to the response variable (Life Expectancy), check for collinearity amongst the predictors, and to propose a model which explains our response variable in the world for the year 2020. Then use an appropriate experimental design to study the average life expectancy across the continents.
